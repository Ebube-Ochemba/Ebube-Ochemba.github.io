            Managing volunteers and events efficiently is a challenge every community organizer faces. Yet, volunteer work is essential for community support and growth.
            This is why we created AidAlley. AidAlley is a volunteer management platform designed to seamlessly connect volunteers with events. Event organizers can easily create events,
            while volunteers can browse and find opportunities in their area. If a volunteer finds an event they are interested in, they can register and track their participation.
            Organizers can manage volunteers, log hours, and ensure everyone stays informed and engaged. This project is the MVP of our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at
             <a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/">Alx Africa</a>. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at 
             the end of the three weeks of development.
